        <a class="gamesubtitle">Responsibilities:</a><br>        
        • Designing a modular quest and dialog system.<br>
        • Developing four science-based modules that cover STEM topics such as the solar system, physics, ecosystem, and the human body. <br>
        • Utilizing the localization dashboard to effectively implement translations for dialog into the game.<br>
        • Concepting and prototyping gameplay after brainstorming with professors from diverse academic backgrounds including linguistics, engineering, and english.<br>

        <a class="gameheading">Photo-taking Mechanics</a><br>
        The premise of the game is to teach refugee learners vocabulary from their native language to English. This is taught by the use of a camera.
        
        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Camera:</a> The player can take photos of objects and items in the environment to receive dialog. The Camera is designed so that if there
        are multiple actors of interest, it targets the closest object by comparing line traces. There are both quest and non-quest specific actors which can be
        photographics at any time or just once. A modular component is added to an actor if it can be photographed making it easy to apply to any actor. This component also
        stores the dialog upon taking the photo.

        <a class="gameheading">Modular Quests</a><br>
        <a class="gamesubtitle">Quest functionality:</a> When starting a quest, goals are added to an array and the player is given a counter to keep track of their progress.
        The player can leave the level where the quest is located as well as save and quit and still return to where they left off.

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Markers:</a> Quest actors derived from a base quest class which provide functionality such as UI markers. These are waypoints that
        can be seen anywhere within the level and appear when the quest starts and disappears once interacted with properly. Markers help prevent the player from getting lost
        or losing track of a quest actor if it is moving. Markers can be disabled for specific actors if they are not needed.

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Interactables:</a> Some quest actors can be completed by taking photos of them while others can be completed by interacting with them through
        the use of a button or switch. This provides an element of variety, allowing the player to still be capable of taking pictures, but also being able to interact with
        the environment to learn about it as well.

        <a class="gameheading">Undergraduate Research Assistant to Independent Contractor</a><br>
        As an undergraduate research assistant, I was originally tasked with assisting the game design professor who was acting as the Lead Designer. After my
        first year he transitioned from academia to industry, leaving me to work solo the following year while the next professor settled in. I proved to be
        invaluable to the project and was hired after graduation over the summer as an independent contractor to finish creating a playable demo of the game.
