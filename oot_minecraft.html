        <a class="gameheading">Player Mechanics</a><br>
        The player has four main abilities. Each power has it's own unique mobility and projectile mechanics which act as the crux for gameplay allowing you to
        platform and solve puzzles.
        
        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Water:</a> Water is the ability the player starts as. This is designed as the players main method of platforming. The player can dash and jump in different ways
        depending on their order of inputs. This allows more advanced movement options such as chain dashing and wave dashing which give you an extra boost if timed
        right. You can shoot water which can interact with the environment such as putting out fires and dispersing mud.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Water.gif" alt="WaterGif">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud:</a> Mud allows you to transform into a ball and roll around. This is used to gain momentum and launch off ramps as well as use it on anti-gravity ramps.
        You can also go through small spaces you wouldn't be able to enter otherwise. You now shoot mud projectiles which are heavy and can weight down
        objects and pulleys. These can be destroyed with water.
        
        <br><br>
           
        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Mud.gif" alt="MudGif">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Ice:</a> Ice can slow down time. The player itself is not affected by the time dilation. This allows you to platform across moving objects you couldn't stand on
        previously as well as interact with multiple objects faster than at normal speeds. The player can shoot ice projectiles which stick to wood and ice
        materials and create platforms. You can shoot multiple projectiles to make a bridge this way. The projectile is also slow when time is slowed allowing you to
        stand on the projectile and ride it.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Ice.gif" alt="IceGif">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Cloud:</a> Cloud has a stronger double jump than water but no dash. Instead, it can become intangible and pass through certain meshes like fencing and grates.
        The player itself acts as the projectile for this power allowing you to launch yourself to distant locations.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Cloud.gif" alt="CloudGif">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gameheading">Modular Mechanics</a><br>
        <a class="gamesubtitle">Weighable Systems:</a> There are weighable and pulley systems that can be used to obstruct or open the players path. They can also act as moving platforms.
        These can be interacted with by weighing them with mud projectiles or un-weighing them by shooting the mud with water. The weighable system is modular
        and can be used to make more systems that mud can interact with in future releases such as rotating wheels.

        <br><br>

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Pipes:</a> Pipes are paths that only projectiles and mud ball can enter. They move along a spline which are easy to modify. There are several settings
        that change the pipes properties such as suction. If the pipe has no suction, the player moves through it as normal. If the pipe does have suction,
        the player gets sucked in and shot out through the other end. Depending on the strenght, this can launch the player or projectiles to far distances.
        You can also set whether the pipe suction goes both ways or only one direction resulting in the otherside lightly pushing you away.

        <br><br>

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud Ramps:</a> These anti-gravity ramps move along a spline that the player can roll up as mud ball. They are very flexible and can go almost anywhere.
        The camera follows the player appearing upright even if upside down. Rolling off flips you back to normal gravity.

        <br><br>

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Matches:</a> The player can pick up matches that can be lit and put out as well as thrown. These abilities provide solutions to puzzles such as starting
        fires, activating switches, burning things, and lighting dark areas. Fire can damage the player so dropping the match and standing on it does damage
        the player. Walking into water with a match also puts it out.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Match.jpg" alt="Match">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gameheading">Boss</a><br>
        Mud Boss has hands which shapeshift into different attacks. The player starts as water which makes it easy to deal with his attacks as they are mud
        and can be shot at. You need mud ability to attack him however so the fight becomes more difficult after collecting the power behind him. This allows
        the player to become familiar with his attack cycles before increasing the difficulty. You must use his attacks against him in order to damage him.

        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud Walls:</a> Mud boss can spawn mud walls from his hands which take on different shapes. They can be dodged or shot at with water.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_MudWalls.gif" alt="MudWalls">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud Projectile:</a> Mud boss can turn his hands into cannons and shoot heat seeking mud projectiles at you. These can also be shot with water or dodged.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_BossProjectile.gif" alt="MudProjectile">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud Suction:</a> Mud boss' cannon hands can suck the player in, shooting them into crystals hanging from above. If mud is shot, it will weigh the crystals above
        down dealing damage to the boss.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Suction.gif" alt="MudSuction">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Mud Hammer:</a> Mud boss can turn his hands into hammers which he uses to try and squish the player. If he misses, a mud ramp spawns allowing the player to climb
        on top of mud boss and weigh the crystals above him down to deal damage.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/Droplette_Hammer.gif" alt="MudHammer">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        After shooting three crystals, pipes replace their locations with hanging chains. Shooting the chains releases water and shrinks the boss until the player
        can finally shoot water themselves and shrink the boss to defeat him.

        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Challenges:</a><br>        
        • Balancing abilities so that each has its own pros and cons so as not to feel limited when using a different power. Water is the only one that can dash, so other
        abilities needed mobility options that could match that speed. Mud ball for example rolls faster than running.<br>
        • Mud Ramps can have complex spline paths which when paired with their anti-gravity properties can be difficult to navigate along. Simplifying the splines
        as much as possible and smoothing camera movement help combat this.
