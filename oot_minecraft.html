        <a class="gameheading">Item Mechanics</a><br>
        The player obtains and uses several items to platform, solve puzzles, and fight enemies effectively. Many items work in different unique ways persuading the player
        to use their full arsenal.
        
        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Hookshot:</a> The hookshot is an item that can stun enemies and take the player to certain walls and objects. It uses a ray trace by using
        recursion in order to detect space for the player to shoot. Checking in a radius along the distance of the ray prevents shooting through corners of blocks.
        Depending on the space around the targeted location, it decides where the player should be located at. If it's on a wall or ceiling, the player will simply stop
        moving. If there is space above the targeted spot, the player will be put on top effectively climbing up it.

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Bombchus:</a> Bombchus are a more advanced version of bombs that follow the direction they are placed down at. It can traverse
        complex terrain and properly inverts its direction when switching between floor and ceiling. It can also detect when bombable objects are in its path and destroy
        it as expected.

        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Boomerang:</a> The boomerang can stun enemies, activate switches, and also pick up items on the ground. It has two modes. The first goes
        in a big arc allowing you to hit multiple things in a circle. This can also help reach targets behind walls you can't directly hit. The other mode allows you to
        aim straight forward which focuses on accuracy and singular targets. Depending on the angle that you look at, it will move along the same path, but the Y height axis
        will adjust accordingly.

        <br><br>

        <a class="gameheading">Enemies</a><br>
        All enemies were designed modularly enabling them to be summoned anywhere in any environment. Each enemy possesses unique attacks and methods of being damaged.

        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Deku Scrubs/Octoroks:</a> These two enemies use projectiles of their own to attack the player. Using a shield the player can reflect
        projectiles back to deal damage. They both will move down to safety if the player gets within melee range. While Octoroks die immediately upon being hit, Deku
        scrubs will only be exposed and run around for a short period of time before returning to the ground. This is an opening for the player to get close and defeat it. 

        <br><br>

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Beamos:</a> Beamos are a unique, stationary enemy that requires the use of bombs to defeat, otherwise being invulnerable. The Beamos
        will spin in circles until the player is in line of sight and shoot a laser as its attack is made by a ray cast. Once the beamos has sights on you, it will repeatedly
        attack until you move out of range or destroy it. These enemies are not usually required to defeat if the player would prefer to sneak around them instead.

        <br><br>

        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Stalfos/Lizalfos:</a> Stalfos and Lizalfos have their own unique attacking AI that is more advanced than the default minecraft mob AI.
        They are capable of dodging in different directions and moving in ways that may be difficult to attack. The Stalfos has a shield which can also be used to defend.
        The player can defeat it by timing their attacks well, but it is recommended to use items to stun them shown by blue particles which give you time to deal multiple
        hits.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">

        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Iron Knuckle:</a> These enemies act as powerful tanks. They both have a ton of health and deal lots of damage. Attacking can be dangerous
        because their attacks have much longer range and ranged attacks don't work on them. They have an attack that swings horizontally covering a lot of area and a vertical
        attack that reaches even further in front. It is easiest to bait them into an attack and then strike as they are slow moving. After they are at half health, part of
        their armor falls off and they become faster. Attacking now stuns them so it's possible to stun lock them until defeated.

        <br><br>

        <br>

        <a class="gameheading">Bosses</a><br>
        There are 10 bosses in the game created, not including minibosses. All of them have their own unique attack patterns and AI.

        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Ganon:</a> Ganon is the final boss of the game having the most advanced fight and animations. He is very large compared to the player with
        his only weakness being his tail. The player has to dodge his two giant sword attacks to get around or run through the legs to get behind in order to attack. This
        can be made easier by shooting projectiles at his head to stun momentarily. This is the only boss that isn't health based and is instead exactly 20 hits. There
        are obstacles in the arena that the player can bait Ganon into and destroy which reveals extra health.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">

        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Bongo Bongo:</a> An invisible being with disembodied hands. This boss fight is meant to disorient the player and force them to keep
        track of many things at once such as attack patterns, player location, and ammo. Its hands are the main focus. They hit a giant drum that acts as the arena
        causing the player to constantly fly into the air. The hands also have a range of attacks from swiping, slamming, punching, and grabbing. The player must
        stun both hands with projectiles while dodging these attacks. Once both are stunned, the boss will charge in which leaves his eye open for an attack in order
        to be defeated.

        <br><br>

        <div class="centertext">
            <img class="game-media" src="/images/gamedetails/oot_bongobongo.gif" alt="BongoBongo">
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Volvagia:</a> Volvagia is a lengthy serpent-like dragon with three main attacks. Each segment of the
        body acts independently of each other using an integer for each part to know what order it goes in. There are nine lava pits in the arena which act as
        a game of whack-a-mole. If you don't attack in time, it will breathe fire on you. It can also fly in the air around you breathing fire in front of it.
        Dodging the fire itself can be easy, but its long body can easily wrap around you making it hard to escape. Its final attack involves it flying up to the ceiling
        and dropping fire rocks around you. Paying attention to where it is above makes it easy to dodge. During its two flying attacks you can actually deal damage
        to the head with projectiles so that it isn't purely a waiting game.

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        <a class="gamesubtitle">Challenges:</a><br>        
        • Inventory Management: The player travels through time making some but not all items in their inventory unusable. A mix of cloning inventory to containers like
        shulker boxes and saving loading data with jukeboxes was used in order to effectively add, remove, and swap items while keeping any ammo the same as well.<br>
        • Minecraft's engine is constantly updating as the project progresses requiring many mechanics to be revisited and updated.
